#Propellers

We offer two kind of propellers:

- [Self-tightening propellers](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/self-tightening-9-4x4-3/)
- [Normal propellers](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/propellers-10x4-5-ccw/)

Propellers generally come in pairs. One should turn in clockwise direction and the other in the opposite. 
Clockwise propellers are also known as "pusher kind" propellers and are marked with an "R" (sometimes it's a "P"). 

According to this assembly description:
- Motors 1 and 2 are counter-clockwise propellers
- Motors 3 and 4 should have clockwise propellers (marked with an "R" or a "P")
