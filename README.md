##Book

In this GitBook we will introduce [Erle-copter](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/tienda/erle-copter), a Linux-based flying multirotor that uses [Erle-brain](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/tienda/erle-brain) autopilot. Erle-copter has about 20 minutes of autonomy (provided a 5000 mAh battery) and can carry up to 2 kg of payload.

The content presented here aims to document this vehicle including how to build, configure, fly and use it.

##About
For years we've been working in the robotics field, particularly with drones. We have passed through different Universities and research centers and in all these places we actually found that most of the **drones are black boxes**. Not meant to be used for learning, research. The software they use is in most of the cases unknown, closed source or *not documented*.

Given these conditions, how are we going to educate the next generations on this technologies? How do you get started programming drones if you don't have $1000+ budget? Which platform allows me to get started with drones without risking a hand?

We are coming up with an answer to all these questions, our technology at [Erle Robotics](http://erlerobotics.com) and our brain for making drones: [Erle-brain](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/tienda/erle-brain).

Inspired by the BeagleBone development board, we have designed a small computer with about 36+ sensors, plenty of I/O and processing power for real-time analysis. [Erle](http://erlerobotics.com) is the enabling technology for the next generation of aerial and terrestrial robots that will be used in cities solving tasks such as surveillance, enviromental monitoring or even providing aid at catastrophes.

Our small-size Linux computer is bringing robotics to the people and businesses.
